This is a Plugin loader for Joxean koret's free bindiff plugin for ida pro.
It uses PySide to match the code in the plugin made by Joxean so there shouldent be a problem in future versions either.


https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora

HOW TO!
Extract archive to ida pro folder
then
Download Diaphora from above link, and extract the content of the archive to QtApps\diaphora matching folder

Load via Plugins menu in ida pro.

ERROR!
properly you haven't set system variables correct look here.
